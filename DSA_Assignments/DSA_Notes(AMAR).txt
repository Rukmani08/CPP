Q.implement stack
Q.impliment stack using queue.
Q.Convert binary to decimal using any Data structure.(Product based)


Examples of DS
stack
queue
linked list
tree
graph

on memeory:-
1>static:- memeory allocated at compile time.easy to give:int a[10];(c++)
once allocated cant changed(drawback)
memeory allocation was on prediction may have underflow or overflow.

static: stack, queue, graph

dynamic: Linked list tree
2>dynamic:- memeory allocated at runtime time.
may need cammands to give: int a[]= new int[20].
once allocated can change as per need(drawback)
memeory allocation  is done on demmand.





on access Linear and non-linear
Linear:- accesse one after another
easy to code easy to understand
-ve:slow

NOn Linear:- accesse direct or via some giuided function.
complex to code as neeed special attention
need time to understand and code
+ve:fast accesss


Q ADT:- Abstract Data types.
List of operations one must implement in order to implement any data structure. it talks about standardization.

DSA are complex entities. They require specific sets of operation to operate on, to access to store or to retrieve information
Hence list of operation are must.


1>Stack

Single sided
LIFO
linear structure

push(10)->insert
pop()->remove an ele

Q.element Accessing  from the mid of stack is not possible.


Diagram of stack and implement stack

push accept an ele on stack
tos+1
void push(int e){
tos++;
stack[tos]=e;
stack[++tos]=e;->in one line
}


tos->-1(no dsata is there in stack)

Boolean is_full(){
if(tos==Maxsize-1){ return true;
}else{
return false;
}


in one line  return  (tos==Maxsize-1);
}


pop---------------------------------------------------------------------------
in pop(){

int temp=stack[tos];
 tos--;
return (temp);

one line return (stack[tos--]);
}


Boolean is_empty(){
  if(tos==-1){
     return true;

}
else{return false;}
}


void print_stack(){\\in LIFO
   for(int i=tos;i>=0;i--){
SOP(stack[i]);}
} 



int peek()//only return ele on top
   {  return (stack[tos]);
}


Q why initially tos is -1
stack-   0-maxsize-1
-1 stays outside the stack

Q.array have index always starts from 0.
 arr itself is a base address swe dont have to add anything into it so  we have 0 as a starting index.


why we use do while loop in menu driven code
do{
}while()->condition check on exit

Q.implement stack using ADT

DAY 2-----------------------------------------------------------------(12/11/25)

QUEUE:- It is double ended linear structure(FIFO) operates from either side for diff operations. 


if we add an element then rear will be increamented.
if we delete an element front will be increamented.

FIFO

we cant operate from the mid line of queue.


Q1.once move ahead it cant reclaim free spaces that have been available due to dequeue.
front and rear are  moving  in only one direction.


SOL to Above Problem: Use Circular Queue........

implememntiing circular Queue

Q2.Explain printing all ele from circular queue.(interview Q)

Circular Queue :-  


we add extra member as count: to count the element in circular queue.
void print_queue()//in FIFO-->front to
rear
{
int i=front,c=0;
while(c<count)
{

System.out.print(queue[i]+" - ");
i=(i+1)%MaxSize;
c++;

}

}



3>PRIORITY QUEUE: follow priority no LIFO AND FIFO

6,8,1,10,5
1>ASCENDING :-1,5,6,8,10


2>DESCENDING:10,8,6,5,1



Q.in order to modify implememnt priority Queue  we would  modify enqueue of linear queue which wiil keep data in sorted order as per need.

4>D-QUEUE:- double ended queue  dequeue and equeue fronm both sides.

                       ->
                       <-    D-queue   ->

Q.Diff between pointer and reference?




Day3--------------------------------------------------------Date:13/11/25

Linked list:
Colln of nodes arranged in a sequential manner,linear, dynamic , can operate from either side ,from midside.

Node :-Node is a variable which contains data and a pointer which is pointing to another variable.

   Data|pointer to next 

does data has multiple value?



class Node{
 int data;
  NOde next;//self ref pointer/ref-> would refer to the same type as type of pointer/ref(itself).

Node(int data){

  this.data=data;
  this.next=null;//no ref to any
}

}

Node n = new Node(10);// node n contain value 10 and refering to null and has an address ex:1800


Node root;// creating a node root
root =n;// root=1800 


structure of linked list.
root
|10|2000|->|20|3100|->|30|null|
   1200            2000     3100



Q>Do u know AGC(Automatic garbage collection)(interview)
if any data is not refernced by any pointer/ref then this data will be automatically released from the memory. 

if root node losts then every next nodes also losts.

Node t = root; t=1200
t=t.next ;   t=2000

1st/left should be root only
right most /last has .next as null.






Q.Creating in-place /im-place sorting for linked list.
Permanent changes done to linked list

✅ What does “in-place sorting” mean?

In-place sorting means:

You sort the linked list without creating a new list.

No extra arrays, no extra linked list.

You only rearrange (swap) the data of nodes inside the same linked list.

Changes are permanent to the original list.

So the original linked list gets sorted → permanently modified.

using bubble sort.------------------------------------------------------------------

Bubble sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

Linked list bubble sort is easy because:---------------------------------------------

Adjacent nodes = current and current.next

You can swap their data values (simplest method)


Node t1=root ;t2=root.next;

while(t1.next.next!=null&&t2.next!=null){
    if(t1.data>t2.data){
      int temp=t1.data;
      t1.data=t2.data;
      t2.data=temp;
   }
   t1=t1.next;
   t2=t2.next;
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sol;-
Node t1, t2;
boolean swapped;

do {
    swapped = false;
    t1 = root;
    t2 = root.next;

    while (t2 != null) {
        if (t1.data > t2.data) {
            int temp = t1.data;
            t1.data = t2.data;
            t2.data = temp;
            swapped = true;
        }
        t1 = t1.next;
        t2 = t2.next;
    }

} while (swapped);

Day5-------------------------------------------------------------------------------(15/11/2025)


Various technique to implement a tree.
1>static array
Represent hierarchical  tree structure into flat array(interview).
Ans :- 2i+1 (for left) and 
       2i+2  for(right child )  
       (i-1)/2   parent 
          
      
             10
           /     \
         20       30
                 /    \
               40      50


soln:
     
Index:  0   1   2   3    4    5    6
Value: [10, 20, 30, -- , -- , 40 , 50]


 





2>Dynamic DLL(Doubly Linked list) approach:-
use of dnode

+ve: Dynamic allocation, compared to other methods easy
-ve: need recurston method as  we can go only from top to bottom.
   Child doesn't know about parent mean doesn't contains the address of parent


+--------+--------+--------+
| prev   | data   | next   | 
| (addr) | (val)  | (addr) |
+--------+--------+--------+



3>Dynamic:tree node approach

+ve: can  use recursion and also. can use sequential normal coding(Stack

Queue

loops (while, for),  inorder,preorder postorder     ) for traversal of tree.
-ve:-Too complex to implement and use due to multipl-pointer system.





+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| prev   | data   | next   | parent |
| (addr) | (val)  | (addr) | (addr) |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+


Q>out of 3 type on implementation of tree which  would use and why?(interview)
if i have  a tree which is arraned in sequence then i can use array (static),
if i want  dynamic location then i go for Dynamic DLL(Doubly Linked list)

and if i dont want recursion and use while loop or normal preorder,inorssder then  
i go for >Dynamic:tree node approach




1) If my tree is complete and arranged in sequence (like a heap), then I can use an array (static representation).
Because the parent/child relationships can be calculated using index formulas, and memory is continuous.

2) If I want dynamic memory allocation, where nodes can be inserted or deleted anywhere, then I use the linked-node representation (NOT DLL — doubly linked list is different).
This is the standard dynamic tree implementation.

3) If I don’t want to use recursion and prefer iterative traversal (while loops, stacks), I would still choose the dynamic tree-node representation, because it supports both recursive and iterative traversals.
-ve:Too complex to implement and use due to multi-pointer
system.
